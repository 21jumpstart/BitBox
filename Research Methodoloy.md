# Akiva Capital: ResearchMethodoloy

Research is begun by collecting sentiment data in bulk from the various macro Crypto Communties on social media sites like Reddit and Twitter.  From there we move into rank the health of the niche micro communties that are forming around a specific token or coin. We do this by following the Open Source Software (OSS) <u>community communications hub</u> which can either be a Slack Chat or reading the developer code submissions on Github to see how the code works. On github we can check how active the developers are and how engaged behind the platform the communties are. 

Further anysis of prospective investments requires chatting with the very eccentric CTOs of these projects. Where we hash out the various  game theory implications and the respective economic model of a token.  Then we work through testing the asset out in various scenarios AND then pushing the team on their goto market and why they will never be able to acquire users AND then analyzing why their OSS freely available software can’t be cloned and the value ripped out.

 From there we use techical analysis indicators and machine learning algorithms to purchase units of crpyto at optimal market prices. Only now you'll under stand why It takes a dedicated and focused study to understand reach reliable conclusion about the merits of:

Iota vs Aeternity vs Ethereum vs Dfinity vs Lisk vs Qtum vs Litecoin vs EOS vs Waves vs Cosmos vs 0x vs Polkadot vs Zcash vs Bitcoin sidechains. 

 Just managing the security of your holdings and hardening yourself and your operation is a constant task in its self. 

Trying to be a normal manager in a space which is multidisciplinary and inchoate and which is not only moving fast but moving fast more *quickly* each month.



## 			How We Help 



 We offer Secure Offline storage for your private Keys: A **private key** in the context of Bitcoin is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent. Every Bitcoin wallet contains one or more private keys, which are saved in the wallet file. The private keys are mathematically related to all Bitcoin addresses generated for the wallet.

Because the private key is the "ticket" that allows someone to spend bitcoins, it is important that these are kept secure. Private keys can be kept on computer files, but in some cases are also short enough that they can be printed on paper.



### Custom Storage for how you'd like to access your money.



Whether than be paper wallet files, digital backups, or even 12 word memory wallets—Our experts will develop a personalized crpyto asset holding strategy that meets your dymanic lifestyle. 

**Cold storage** in the context of Bitcoin refers to keeping a reserve of Bitcoins offline. This is often a necessary security precaution, especially dealing with large amounts of Bitcoin.

It connects to any computer (USB) and embeds a secure OLED display to double-check and confirm each transaction with a single tap on its side buttons.-->

Methods of cold storage include keeping bitcoins:

-  In a safe place (e.g. safe deposit box, Vault)
- On a [paper wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet)
- On a bearer item such as a [physical bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Physical_bitcoin).
- Use a offline Bitcoin [Hardware wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardware_wallet)
